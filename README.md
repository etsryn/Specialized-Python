## 📌 Contents

This repository includes structured content on the following libraries:

- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing with powerful n-dimensional array objects
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning algorithms, preprocessing tools, and model evaluation
- **Seaborn** – Statistical data visualization for drawing informative graphs
- **Matplotlib** – Comprehensive 2D plotting library
- **FastAPI** – A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python
- **REST API** – Concepts and implementation of RESTful APIs for integrating applications
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** – Deep Learning frameworks for building neural networks
- **NLTK & SpaCy** – Libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **OpenCV** – Computer vision library for image processing
- **Statsmodels** – Statistical modeling and econometrics
- **XGBoost & LightGBM** – Gradient boosting frameworks for efficient ML models
- **Flask & Django** – Web frameworks often used to deploy AI models
- And many more...
